# Neural Network Report

Overview: 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a tool to Alphabet Soup that can help it select the applicants for funding. We will be creating a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using data from past funding recipients. 

Results:

Data Preprocessing

Target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
Feature variables for the model is the rest of the dataframe, dropping the IS_SUCCESSFUL column:

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
